# Pie-De-Way
This game is developed for [StopWaitingForGodot game jam](https://itch.io/jam/stop-waiting-for-godot). Pie De Way means lining up in Traditional Chinese. It's the direct pronunciation translation from 「排隊」. You play as a dumb ass lining up for......?!

It's a lining up simulator. You can just lining up or try to do something else (interesting) while lining up.  Feel free to tell us how many interesting stuff/Easter eggs you have found! (I thing you may need  explanations of some of them :D)

p.s. We haven't dealt with localization yet, so just enjoy the beautiful traditional Chinese at every ending! (of course you can ask in the comment, we will reply!

------------
Still in development! Still many godotfied NPCs to be added to lining up with you! And more ending to come!
